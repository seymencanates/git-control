WHAT IS GIT?

Git is: 
    A popular version control system. It was created for the checks versions , updates , who made this changes
    and updates and in addition to we can also track our code changes since we began to the project.

We can manage project with repositories
We can clone a project to work lo the local area
We can control and track changes with stacking and committing
Branch and merge allows to work on the different parts of project
We can pull the latest version of project to a local copy
Or push local updates to main project


I will use built-in terminal for the track changes.
